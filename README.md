# NLP Multiclass Disaster Response Prediction Model with Flask App

1. This Project reads data from 2 different CSV files -
* disaster_messages.csv - Contains text data for messages recorded during time of disaster
* disaster_categories.csv - Contains categories classified for these text messages

2. Data is cleaned and stored in an sqlite database

3. Data is read from this sqlite database and converted into tokens

4. Data is split into train and test, then trainied using RandomForest multiclass classifier

5. Results are displayed using a flask web app and user can also categorize his own text using this app

## Description (WIP)

This project is part of Udacity Nanodegree. So someone who just started out with data science and is looking to explore a simple code that takes you from level 1 to level 2 in data science, this project is then for you.

This 1 python file -
* Inputs Data
* Processes and Cleans relevant information
* Does basic descriptive analytics
* Predicts price of listing using a neural network regression model

## Getting Started (WIP)

### Dependencies
